# CONTRIBUTING

If you happen to find a bug, use the issues and pull requests. I will be more than happy to help, revise and perhaps incorporate
the proposed changes into the codebase. Likewise for feature requests feel free contact via here, gitter or email. Any help is appreciated.

I sincerely thank you for your support,

Ibrahim Tanyalcin
