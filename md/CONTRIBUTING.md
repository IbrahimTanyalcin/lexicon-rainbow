# CONTRIBUTING

If you happen to find a bug, use the issues and pull requests. I will be more than happy to help, revise and perhaps incorporate
the proposed changes into the codebase. Likewise for feature requests feel free contact via here, [gitter](https://gitter.im/lexicon-rainbow) or email. Any help is appreciated.

I sincerely thank you for your support,

Ibrahim Tanyalcin
