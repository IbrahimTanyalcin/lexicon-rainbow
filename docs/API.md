```js
lexiconRainbow.toggleGUI([bool]) {Boolean} //ex: lexiconRainbow.toggleGUI(false) --> turns off the gui
```

* Togges the [GUI][GUI] on or off. 
* No argument supplied means as if `false` has been specified.
* This is not meant to be called by the developer but it actually called by `lexiconRainbow.GUI`.

#### toggleAxis [:link:](#toggleaxis-link)<a href="../dev/lexiconRainbow.d3v4.dev.js#L135-L144">üîç</a>

```js
lexiconRainbow.toggleAxis([bool]) {Boolean|String} //ex: lexiconRainbow.toggleAxis("Red") --> paints the axis red
```

* Togges the axis on or off. 
* No argument supplied means as if `false` has been specified.
* If the argument is a truthy value AND a color string(hex, rgb, rgba or one of html color names), then the axis is turned on with that color.
* This is not meant to be called by the developer but it actually called by [`lexiconRainbow.changeScale`](../dev/lexiconRainbow.d3v4.dev.js#L1763)
which is dynamically added after calling [`lexiconRainbow.append`](../dev/lexiconRainbow.d3v4.dev.js#L989).
