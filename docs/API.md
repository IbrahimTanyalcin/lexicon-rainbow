# <a id="h1" href="#h1">API REFERENCE </a>

This document describes the methods you can call on the LexiconRainbow instance. Refer to the 
[LEGEND][LEGEND] section of the [README][README] file to have list of abbreviations used in this document.

## QUICSTART
Refer to the [API][QUICSTART] section of the [README][README] to have an idea of a general use case. Just a hint:
* `.append` and `.render` methods are always called **LAST**.
* Look out for the :warning: signs, they usually mark methods that is **NOT** inteded to be called by you but rather documented for completeness.
* Look out for the :+1: signs, they usually point out to something that might worth a try.
* Look out for the :-1: signs, they usually point out to something that might **NOT** be good to try.

### INPUT DATA STRUCTURE


### METHODS

#### toggleGUI [:link:](#togglegui-link)[üîç][toggleGUI]

```js
lexiconRainbow.toggleGUI([bool]) {Boolean} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.toggleGUI(false) --> turns off the gui
```

* Togges the [GUI][GUI] on or off. 
* No argument supplied means as if `false` has been specified.
* :warning: This is not meant to be called by the developer but it actually called by [`lexiconRainbow.GUI`][.GUI].

#### toggleAxis [:link:](#toggleaxis-link)[üîç][toggleAxis]

```js
lexiconRainbow.toggleAxis([bool]) {Boolean|String} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.toggleAxis("Red") --> paints the axis red
```

* Togges the axis on or off. 
* No argument supplied means as if `false` has been specified.
* If the argument is a truthy value AND a color string(hex, rgb, rgba or one of html color names), then the axis is turned on with that color.
* :warning: This is not meant to be called by the developer but it actually called by [`lexiconRainbow.changeScale`][changeScale]
which is dynamically added after calling [`lexiconRainbow.append`][append].

#### setViewBox [:link:](#setviewbox-link)[üîç][setViewBox]

```js
lexiconRainbow.setViewBox([x,y,w,h]) {Number, Number, Number, Number} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.setViewBox(0,0,600,200) --> registeres a function to set viewBox
//x and y are origin, w stands for width, h stands for height
```

* Registers a function to set the svg [viewBox][w3c-viewbox]. 
* This is not meant to be called by the developer but it is actually called by [`lexiconRainbow.GUI`][.GUI].
* :warning: Nothing will happen when you call this, a new function will be registered waiting to be called by some other higher level function.

#### setCanvasDims [:link:](#setcanvasdims-link)[üîç][setCanvasDims]

```js
lexiconRainbow.setCanvasDims([w,h]) {Number, Number} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.setCanvasDims(600,200) --> registeres a function to set canvas dimensions
//w stands for width, h stands for height
```

* Registeres a function to set the canvas dimensions. 
* This is not meant to be called by the developer but it actually called by [`lexiconRainbow.GUI`][.GUI].
* :warning: Nothing will happen when you call this, a new function will be registered waiting to be called by some other higher level function.
* In versions of IE, svg cannot be scaled properly, so the aim is to force the position css property of the svg to absolute while forcing the 
browser to scale based on the width and height of the canvas element with the css display property set to "hidden". 

#### lexID [:link:](#lexid-link)[üîç][lexID]

```js
lexiconRainbow.lexID([id]) {String} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.lexID("someInstance") --> the created svg will have an id attribute of "someInstance"
```

* Gives the created svg the specified id string and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instace.
* If no arguement is given, then returns the id string of the created svg instead.

#### x [:link:](#x-link)[üîç][x]

```js
lexiconRainbow.x([x]) {Number} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.x(10) --> the created svg will have an origin x-offset of 10 in units of userSpaceOnUse
```

* Not calling this at all implies the default value of x which is 0.
* Sets the origin-x coordinate of the created svg's [viewBox][w3c-viewbox] attribute to the specified value and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.
* :-1: Setting this effectively shifts the viewBox right or left, potentially concealing other elements. There is no reason to call this method unless
you deliberately want to offset.

#### y [:link:](#y-link)[üîç][y]

```js
lexiconRainbow.y([y]) {Number} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.y(10) --> the created svg will have an origin y-offset of 10 in units of userSpaceOnUse
```

* Not calling this at all implies the default value of y which is 0.
* Sets the origin-y coordinate of the created svg's [viewBox][w3c-viewbox] attribute to the specified value and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.
* :-1: Setting this effectively shifts the viewBox down or up, potentially concealing other elements. There is no reason to call this method unless
you deliberately want to offset.

#### w [:link:](#w-link)[üîç][w]

```js
lexiconRainbow.w([w]) {Number} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.w(600) --> the created svg will have a width of 600 in units of userSpaceOnUse
```

* Not calling this at all implies the default value of w which is 100, probably **NOT** what you want.
* Sets the width of the created svg's [viewBox][w3c-viewbox] attribute to the specified value and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.
* :+1: You might want to set the width larger than the height something like 600 to 200 or maybe something close to golden ratio (w = ~1.618*h).
In anycase, the text size will be adjusted automatically.

#### h [:link:](#h-link)[üîç][h]

```js
lexiconRainbow.h([h]) {Number} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.h(200) --> the created svg will have an height of 200 in units of userSpaceOnUse
```

* Not calling this at all implies the default value of h which is 100, probably **NOT** what you want.
* Sets the height of the created svg's [viewBox][w3c-viewbox] attribute to the specified value and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.
* :+1: You might want to set the width larger than the height something like 600 to 200 or maybe something close to golden ratio (w = ~1.618*h).
In anycase, the text size will be adjusted automatically.

#### sW [:link:](#sw-link)[üîç][sW]

```js
lexiconRainbow.sW([styleWidth]) {String|Number} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.sW("1000px") --> the created svg will have a viewport width of 1000 pixels
```

* Not calling this at all implies the default value of sW which is "100px", probably **NOT** what you want.
* Specifying a number is assumed to indicate pixels as units.
* Sets the viewport width of the created svg to the specified value and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.
* :+1: Keep the aspect ratio same as your specified w and h values. For instance, if you have a width of 1000 and a height of 500
and you specified sW to be "400px", then make sure your sH is set to "200px". Deviating from this ratio too much will eventually
distort the image as the [preserveAspectRatio][w3c-preserveAspectRatio] is always set to "none".

#### sH [:link:](#sh-link)[üîç][sH]

```js
lexiconRainbow.sH([styleHeight]) {String|Number} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.sH("400px") --> the created svg will have a viewport height of 400 pixels
```

* Not calling this at all implies the default value of sH which is "100px", probably **NOT** what you want.
* Specifying a number is assumed to indicate pixels as units.
* Sets the viewport height of the created svg to the specified value and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.
* :+1: Keep the aspect ratio same as your specified w and h values. For instance, if you have a width of 1000 and a height of 500
and you specified sW to be "400px", then make sure your sH is set to "200px". Deviating from this ratio too much will eventually
distort the image as the [preserveAspectRatio][w3c-preserveAspectRatio] is always set to "none".

#### position [:link:](#position-link)[üîç][position]

```js
lexiconRainbow.position([CSSposition]) {String} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.position("absolute") --> the created svg will have a CSS position property of 'absolute'
```

* Defaults to "relative".
* Sets the CSS position property of the created svg to the specified string and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.

#### color [:link:](#color-link)[üîç][color]

```js
lexiconRainbow.color([colorName]) {String} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.color("LightRed") --> the created svg will have a background rectangle color of 'LightRed'
```

* Defaults to "DimGray".
* Sets the fill attribute of the created svg rect to the specified string and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.
* :-1: The background rectangle is hidden by default in lexicon-rainbow. It covers the area behind the plotted elements.
The method exist to keep methods similar with other lexicon modules.

#### colorScale [:link:](#colorscale-link)[üîç][colorscale]

```js
lexiconRainbow.colorScale([scaleFunction]) {Function} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.colorScale(function(i){return ["#000000","#a00500",#05a000,#0005a0][i % 4]})
//registers a new function that returns color from an ordinal scale
```

* Defaults to  `d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory20)`.
* This is used when the user does not provide any color input.

#### opacity [:link:](#opacity-link)[üîç][opacity]

```js
lexiconRainbow.opacity([opacity]) {String|Number} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.opacity(0.7) --> the created svg will have a background rectangle opacity of '0.7'
```

* Defaults to 0.
* Sets the fill-opacity attribute of the created svg rect to the specified string or number and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.
* :-1: The background rectangle is hidden by default in lexicon-rainbow. It covers the area behind the plotted elements.
The method exist to keep methods similar with other lexicon modules.

#### container [:link:](#container-link)[üîç][container]

```js
lexiconRainbow.container([CSS-SelectorString|Node]) {String|Object} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.container("#myDiv")
//the created svg will be inserted as the lastChild (at the moment when lexicon.append is called)
//of a flow content element with the id of "myDiv"
```

* Defaults to `document.body`.
* Sets the `parentElement` of the created svg to the specified string or object and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.
* :+1: You do not want to leave this option default. 
Always specify a container either with the form of a [CSS selector][w3c-cssSelector] or node reference.

#### sTop [:link:](#stop-link)[üîç][stop]

```js
lexiconRainbow.sTop([Length in CSS units]) {String} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.sTop("100px") --> the created svg will have a css top property of 100px.
```

* Defaults to `0px`.
* Sets the css top property of the created svg to the specified string and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.

#### sLeft [:link:](#sleft-link)[üîç][sleft]

```js
lexiconRainbow.sLeft([Length in CSS units]) {String} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.sLeft("100px") --> the created svg will have a css left property of 100px.
```

* Defaults to `0px`.
* Sets the css left property of the created svg to the specified string and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.

#### sMargin [:link:](#smargin-link)[üîç][smargin]

```js
lexiconRainbow.sMargin([Length in CSS units]) {String} 
//ex: lexiconRainbow.sLeft("100px 50px")

```

* Defaults to `0px`.
* Sets the css margin property of the created svg to the specified string and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.

#### input [:link:](#input-link)[üîç][input]

```js
lexiconRainbow.input([Input]) {Object} 
//ex: 
//var sample = {ordinal:[...],linear:[...]};
//lexiconRainbow.input(sample);
//the created svg will plot the data specified in the input object.
```

* Defaults to `undefined`.
* :+1: This is one of the core methods of the library. LexiconRainbow instance does **NOT** mutate the object that 
is passed via `.input` method. But if you change the input object, then you need to recall `.render` to reflect these changes. 

#### handleEvent [:link:](#handleevent-link)[üîç][handleevent]

```js
lexiconRainbow.handleEvent([functionRef]) {function} 
/*ex: 
var handleEvent = function(data,type,eventType){
	if(eventType !== "mouseover"){return}
	console.log("interval "+data.index+" of "+data.item);
};
lexiconRainbow.handleEvent(handleEvent);
*/
//the lexiconRainbow instace will pass data to the specified function.
```

* Defaults to `(function(){})` with this bound to the lexiconRainbow instance.
* Sets the handleEvent function and returns the `lexiconRainbow` instance.
* :+1: You bind only single function to the lexiconRainbow instance which handles all event types and data
handled to it. Check the table below for **when** and **what arguments** are passed. `linearID` and `ordinalID`
are internal variables and refer to the index of the current ordinal/linear data object. Do not forget that
`d3.event.type` is the native DOM `event.type`:
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<td>when</td>
			<td colspan="3">arguments</td>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>data object</td>
		<td>type</td>
		<td>eventType</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>The first time render function is called</td>
		<td>
			<pre>{
linear: _input_.linear[linearID],
ordinal: _input_.ordinal[ordinalID]
}
			</pre>
		</td>
		<td>"onload"</td>
		<td>null</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>User hovers on an item on the ordinal scale</td>
		<td>
			<pre>{
				name: d<sup>*</sup>,
				item: _input_.linear[linearID].categories[d]
			}
			</pre>
		</td>
		<td>"onpick"</td>
		<td>d3.event.type</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>None of the categories in the ordinal scale matches the ones in the linear scale: nothing to show.</td>
		<td>null</td>
		<td>"onmismatch"</td>
		<td>null</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>User hovers on a link/ribbon</td>
		<td>
			<pre>{
				name: names[ii]<sup>**</sup>,
				item: dd<sup>***</sup>,
				parent: _input_.linear[linearID].categories[d],
				index: ii<sup>**</sup>
			}
			</pre>
		</td>
		<td>"onpick"</td>
		<td>event.type<sup>****</sup></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Either through the GUI or programmatic access the ordinal or the linear data object is changed</td>
		<td>
			<pre>_input_.linear[linearID]
			or
			_input_.ordinal[ordinalID]
			</pre>
		</td>
		<td>
			<pre>"onrenderLinear" 
			or
			"onrenderOrdinal"
			</pre>
		</td>
		<td>null</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<sup>
<pre>
	*: d is the 'key' within the category, it is the name you see on the plot.
	**: name of the interval, if specified, otherwise undefined`
	***: value of the current interval
	****: For both mobile and desktop, you will receive "onmouseover". 
	For mouseout, in desktop you will receive "mouseout" and mobile, you will receive "touchend".
